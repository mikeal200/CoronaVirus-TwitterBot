# CoronaVirus-TwitterBot
This twitterbot will grab json from api.covid19api.com and post info daily on twitter using the twitter api. Statistics may vary from source to source but none are exactly the same.

if you clone this repo you need a my_secrets.py file with four constants API_KEY, API_SECRET_KEY, ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET you populate these with your own keys from the twitter api.
